## Phase 2 Implementation Request

**Objective**: Implement advanced reasoning features including enhanced branching systems and multi-agent debate capabilities.

### Priority Implementation Order

#### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2.1: Enhanced Branching System (Medium Priority)
**Research Basis**: Tree of Thoughts (ToT) shows +25% improvement with b=5 branches

**Key Features to Implement**:
- Branch merging capabilities with quality preservation
- Lookahead evaluation for future reasoning paths
- Breadth-first and depth-first search algorithms
- Intelligent branch pruning mechanism (reduce computation by 40%)
- Branch quality scoring system

**Technical Requirements**:
```typescript
interface BranchSearchConfig {
  algorithm: 'bfs' | 'dfs' | 'best-first';
  lookahead: number;
  pruning: boolean;
  mergeStrategy: 'consensus' | 'best' | 'weighted';
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Support 5+ concurrent branches efficiently
- Implement search algorithms with configurable strategies
- Enable branch merging while preserving reasoning quality
- Maintain existing branching functionality compatibility

#### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2.2: Multi-Agent Debate Mode (Medium Priority)
**Research Basis**: Multi-agent debate frameworks improve complex reasoning

**Key Features to Implement**:
- Multiple reasoning agents with different perspectives
- Debate round system with argument exchange
- Argument critique and refinement mechanisms
- Consensus building algorithm with convergence detection
- Agent confidence scoring and position tracking

**Technical Requirements**:
```typescript
interface DebateAgent {
  id: string;
  position: string;
  arguments: ThoughtData[];
  confidence: number;
}

interface DebateSession {
  agents: DebateAgent[];
  rounds: number;
  consensus: string;
  convergence: boolean;
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Support 2-4 debate agents effectively
- Achieve consensus within 3-5 rounds
- Improve complex problem solving by 20%
- Maintain reasoning transparency throughout debate

## Implementation Guidelines

### Current Codebase Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts       # Type definitions (includes ConsensusData, RollbackState, AutoCoTConfig)
â”œâ”€â”€ server.ts      # Main server logic with Phase 1 features
â”œâ”€â”€ tools.ts       # MCP tool definitions
â””â”€â”€ index.ts       # Entry point

tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ consensus.test.ts  # Self-consistency tests (17 tests)
â”œâ”€â”€ rollback.test.ts   # Rollback tests (14 tests)
â”œâ”€â”€ auto-cot.test.ts   # Auto-CoT tests (27 tests)
â”œâ”€â”€ server.test.ts     # Core server tests
â”œâ”€â”€ tools.test.ts      # Tool definition tests
â””â”€â”€ types.test.ts      # Type validation tests
```

### Development Approach
1. **Follow established patterns** from Phase 1 implementation
2. **Maintain test coverage** - aim for comprehensive testing of new features
3. **Preserve backward compatibility** - all existing features must continue working
4. **Follow @devdocs/rules.md** - adhere to development guidelines
5. **Modular implementation** - add new features without breaking existing architecture

### Integration Points
- **Tool Schema Updates**: Add new parameters for branch search and debate mode
- **Server Class Extensions**: Add methods for advanced branching and debate functionality  
- **Response Format**: Extend existing response structure with new feature data
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation for new parameters and edge cases

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Cover all new methods and functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Verify compatibility with existing Phase 1 features
- **Edge Cases**: Handle invalid inputs, resource limits, and error conditions
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure efficient operation with multiple branches/agents

## Getting Started

When ready to continue with Phase 2 implementation:

1. **Review Current Implementation**: Examine Phase 1 code structure and patterns
2. **Start with Phase 2.1**: Begin with enhanced branching system as foundation
3. **Follow TDD Approach**: Write tests first, then implement functionality
4. **Incremental Development**: Build features step-by-step with continuous testing
5. **Integration Testing**: Verify compatibility with all existing Phase 1 features

**Command to Begin**: Simply say "continue with Phase 2" and specify which sub-phase (2.1 or 2.2) to start with.
